# Algorithm Notes

This is simply a repository to hold implementations of various sorting and searching algorithms, useful for when I'm interviewing for jobs. Most of my notes are maintained locally with [Logseq](https://logseq.com), but I may export some to this repository in the future. A website version with visualizations would be interesting to create as well.
